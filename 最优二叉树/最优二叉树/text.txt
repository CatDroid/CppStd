What is Shanghai?
	On the morning of June 20th 1830, Lord Amnerst, the first British ship to visit Shanghai was anchored at the mouth of Huangpu,
	two Europeans strode ashore. These men were Charles Gutzlaff, translator and missionary, and Hill Lynsay, representative of 
the British East India Company. Crowds gathered together to witness these so-called barbarians; though in his report Linsay mentioned 
cotton cloth and calico, his real objective was to sell opium. Nine years later, the opium war broke out. After the Chinese was defeated 
by Britain, Shanghai became one of the cities opened to foreign trade by the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, and a new city began to develop.
